***Meetings will be seperated into their respective groups (unless something needs the opinion of everyone).***

The landing page has been fiddled out and I think we've came to the conclusion on the landing page. Now it's time to deisgn the rest. Good job Design team.

## Things to do:
- [ ] Setup the Github
- [ ] Revise the Landing Page's visuals and design philosophy

## Critiques from Panelists:
- [ ] "Misleading Title. Must Change Title."
- [ ] "Change Flowchart. Remove all colors and make it a straight line."
- [ ] "Put recommendation books for certain Grade Levels."
- [ ] "Could add book of the week." (Optional: don't do if too hard.)
- [ ] "Add activity logs." *(IMPORTANT)*
- [ ] "Research about the School Library of how the process of viewing books work."
- [ ] "Next presentation must be navigated throgouhly." *(Feb. 28 [?])*
